### Bytecode Hell
In light of my obsession with bytecode formats, here's a list of formats i've reversed/implemented
- [TFX Expression Bytecode](https://github.com/cohaereo/alkahest/blob/lightfall/docs/shaders/bytecode.md): Reversed + implemented
  - The expression bytecode that powers the rendering pipeline of the Tiger engine, used in Destiny 1 + 2
- Unnamed Tiger Engine Bytecode: Currently reversing
  - Similar to TFX expressions, but for other, currently unknown purposes
- JVM Bytecode: Implemented (HSJVM)
- Gamemaker VM Bytecode: Implemented (Valkyrie)
